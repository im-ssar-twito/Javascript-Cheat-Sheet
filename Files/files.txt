FormData - 
The FormData interface provides a way to easily construct
a set of key/value pairs representing form fields and their values,
which can then be easily sent using the fetch().

FileReader -
The FileReader object lets web applications asynchronously
read the contents of files (or raw data buffers)
stored on the user's computer, using File or Blob objects
to specify the file or data to read.
